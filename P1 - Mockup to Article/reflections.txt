The basics of website-making is covered. I learnt how a webpage is made completly out of scratch.
Whole of the experience was very easy, except for the time whent the code becomes too long (It scares me sometimes :P ).
Most of the tags used in this project were easy to used and were covered in classroom itself, so it was easy enough to finish most of the project, in other cases I had to look up Mozilla's MDN for reference
