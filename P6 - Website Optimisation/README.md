Website optimisation
========================
How to view:
1.	Open index.html in chrome/mozilla or any any browser
2.	Check load time and page speed by opening developer tools >> network tab
========================
What has been done:
1.	The JavaScript and css files have been minified for smaller sizes.
2.	Bit depth and resolution of images have been lowered for less byte consumption.
3.	JavaScript now loads asynchronously and does not affects loading of webpage.
