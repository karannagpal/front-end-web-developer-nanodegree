		To<br>The future Karan
	</b>
	<p>
		Whats up bro? <br>
		I hope this letter finds you in best of your spirits and in the same 
		enthusiasm as you started this Nanodegree.
		However, there are times when you are struck and are not able to find a 
		way out. Here are some tips you can try out.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Take a nap</li>
		<li>Take a walk</li>
		<li>Take a break and then get back to work</li>
		<li>Ask questions, to yourself and others</li>
		<li>Draw diagrams/flowcharts on a paper</li>
		<li>Troubleshoot using browser developer tools</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Being wrong means you are <em><u>not right yet.</u></em>, so believe 
		in yourself, you <b>can</b> do it. <br>

		<code>
			Avoid being over-dependent on your talent and skipping hard work altogether.
		</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		Remember,
		<blockquote>
			If talent is like a jewel, hard work is jeweler.
		</blockquote>
	</p>
	<p>
		Lastly, I just wanna mention that don't worry about the failures to 
		come and
		<b>
			<u>
				NEVER SETTLE
			</u>
		</b>
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>Yours' self,</em>
